This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <tags>argus monitor fan control</tags>
    <summary>Argus Monitor is an alternative to the well known tool SpeedFan and at the moment the best application for software fan control for Windows.</summary>
    <description>If you are looking for a program to control your CPU fan, GPU fans or system fans, then Argus Monitor might be best program for that purpose. With the fan control features of Argus Monitor you can control the fans of your PC, and set either a fixed fan speed or control them based on any of the temperature sources available on your system. It is for instance possible to control the fan speeds of your case fans based on the temperatures of your CPU, the GPU temperature, disk temperatures, RAM temperatures, mainboard temperature sensors or sensor readings provided by an AIO or external fan controller — or a combination thereof.</description>
    <releaseNotes>- Added an option to also include the GPU fan control into the fan control profiles (this option has to be enabled in the program settings).enter code here
- New option to monitor  [HDD S.M.A.R.T. data from Network Attached Storage (NAS)](https://help.argusmonitor.com/SMARTonNetworkAttachedStorageNAS.html).
- Added 3 new synthetic temperatures (Offset, Saturation, Lower Limit).
- Warning for additional fan control software running in parallel can now be disabled (only for cases that are not dangerous from our point of view).
-   Several minor improvements and bug fixes.</releaseNotes>
